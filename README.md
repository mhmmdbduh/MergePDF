# PDF Merger
This application is a simple tool that allows you to merge multiple PDF files into a single document. The application is written in Python, and makes use of the PyPDF2 library to handle PDF files and the Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface. Will be availiable as executable file in the near future.

### How to use
To use the application, you'll need to have Python and the PyPDF2 and Tkinter libraries installed on your computer.

* Run the main.py script {might be changed in the future} to start the application.
* Click the 'Select PDFs' button.
* Choose the files that you want to merge by using the file explorer that will open.
* Choose the destination folder where you want to save the merged file.
* Wait until the message "Files merged successfully!" is displayed.

The application has a simple GUI with a file explorer from where you can select the PDF files you want to merge. Once selected, the application will merge all selected files into a single PDF, in the order that you have selected them. The output file will be in the destination folder script and will be named as filename you choose.
